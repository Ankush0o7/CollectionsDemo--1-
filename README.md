# Collection Examples

This repository contains Java examples focusing on the usage of collections, specifically demonstrating `List` and `Set` implementations.

## List Demo

### Purpose

The `ListDemo` class showcases various methods to iterate through a `List`.

### Usage

#### Enhanced For Loop (`List`)

```java
for (String item : list) {
    System.out.println(item);
}


This Markdown snippet showcases the Java code within triple backticks, followed by an explanatory comment. You can then proceed with the next section of your README after the comment, continuing with any additional content or sections you'd like to include.
## Set Demo

### Purpose

The `SetDemo` class illustrates the behavior of a `Set`, specifically a `HashSet`, where duplicate elements are not allowed.

### Usage

#### Iterating Through `Set`

```java
for (String book : books) {
    System.out.print(book + " ");
}
